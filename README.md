# SONAR Rock and Mine Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project to classify SONAR signals as either rock or mine (metal cylinder) using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this project is the SONAR dataset, which consists of 208 instances with 60 features each.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify SONAR signals as either rocks or mines. This has practical applications in underwater exploration and mining.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the SONAR dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of 208 instances and 60 features. Each feature is a value representing the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time.

- **Classes**: Rock, Mine
- **Instances**: 208
- **Features**: 60

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The requirements.txt file should include the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- sckit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SONAR-Rock-and-Mine-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd SONAR-Rock-and-Mine-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train and evaluate the models:
### Using Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook - Open the test.ipynb notebook in the Jupyter interface and run the cells to train and evaluate the models.

### Using Python Script:
If you have a Python script named test.py, you can run it directly:
```sh
python test.py
```

## Models
The following machine learning algorithms have been implemented and evaluated in this project:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

## Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy.
